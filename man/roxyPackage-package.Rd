The intention of this package is to make packaging R code as easy as possible.
'roxyPackage' uses tools from the 'roxygen2' package to generate documentation. It also
automatically generates and updates files like *-package.R, DESCRIPTION, CITATION,
      ChangeLog and
NEWS.Rd. Building packages supports source format, as well as several binary formats (MS
Windows, Mac OS X,
      Debian GNU/Linux) if the package contains pure R code only. The packages
built are stored in a fully functional local R package repository which can be synced to a web
server to share them with others. This includes the generation of browsable HTML pages
similar to CRAN,
      with support for RSS feeds from the ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for
a more detailed explanation by example.
